<h1>Food Generator*</h1>

<h4>*I probably should have named it 'food picker' as it does not actually <em>generate</em> food.</h2>

<p>This is my first project as a self taught developer. My programming journey started around two months ago, so I chose something simple for my first project.</p>

<p>In order to create this project I used <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,and some <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>

<p>Although the page is not 100% responsive, it is a feature that I wanted to add.</p>
